attest is a command-line tool that tests a program for given input and expected
output. I made this for quickly checking validity of my program locally when
solving competitive programming problems.

## Install

Pre-compiled static executables are listed in the **Assets** box in the
[release page][release-url]. Download one for your platform and put it into
your ~/bin directory as `attest`.


## Usage

Create test files in `tests` directory as `*.txt` files. Test file contains
program input and expected output delimited by "---".

```console
$ ls tests
test1.txt  test2.txt  test3.txt

$ cat tests/test1.txt
2
0 1
1 0
---
1
```

Run `attest ./a.out` to test your program `./a.out` against the test files:

```console
$ attest ./a.out
PASS  0:01  test1.txt
PASS  0:05  test2.txt
PASS  0:03  test3.txt
```

Each line shows test outcome, execution time and test filename. The test
outcome is one of these:

| Outcome | Meaning                      |
|---------|------------------------------|
| PASS    | Program output was correct   |
| FAIL    | Program output was incorrect |
| TIME    | Program took too long        |
| DEAD    | Program crashed              |

Pass `-v` option to inspect the output of failed tests. Specify `-vv` to show
output of all tests.

```console
$ attest -v ./a.out
PASS  0:01  test1.txt
FAIL  0:00  test2.txt

FAIL  test2.txt
  Test case
    IN:
    3
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 0
    OUT:
    9
  Program
    OUT:
    0
```


## Makefile automation

You may want to use Makefile to automate compilation and testing. Suppose you
have source file `main.c` and test files in `test` directory:

```console
$ ls *
main.c

tests:
test1.txt  test2.txt  test3.txt
```

Create this Makefile:

```make
CFLAGS = -std=gnu99 -O2 -g

.PHONY: test clean
test: main
	attest -v ./main
clean:
	rm -f main
```

`CFLAGS` (`CXXFLAGS` if you use C++) is optional but useful to have. You may
add extra compiler flags like `-I/usr/local/include` and `-fsanitize=address`.

With this setup, you can compile the program and test it by simply typing `make`
after making modifications to the source code.

```console
$ ls
main.c  Makefile  tests

$ make
cc -std=gnu99 -O2    main.c   -o main
attest -v ./main
PASS  0:00  test1.txt
PASS  0:00  test2.txt
FAIL  0:00  test3.txt

FAIL  test3.txt
  Test case
    IN:
    -100
    OUT:
    200
  Program
    OUT:
    -200
make: *** [Makefile:5: test] Error 1
```

Edit source code, type `make`, see test result, identify the issue and fix it.
Repeat this to create a program that passes all tests.


## Options

```
usage: attest [-v ...] [options] <command>...

options:
  -d <tests>    Directory containing test files [default: tests]
  -f <digits>   Test numbers for specified number of decimal places
  -j <jobs>     Number of concurrent runs; 0 means maximum [default: 0]
  -t <timeout>  Timeout in seconds; 0 means no timeout [default: 0]
  -v            Display detailed test results; -v for only failed tests and -vv
                for all tests
  -h            Show this message and exit
```


## Testing

Requires Go 1.13 and POSIX commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/snsinfu/attest
cd attest
make test
```
