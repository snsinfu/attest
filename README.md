attest is a command-line tool that tests a program for given input and expected
output. I made this for quickly checking validity of my program locally when
solving competitive programming problems.

## Install

Download `attest` binary from the [release page][release-url]. Pre-compiled
static executables are listed in the **Assets** box.


## Usage

Create test files in `tests` directory as `*.txt` files. Test file contains
program input and expected output delimited by "---".

```console
$ ls tests
test1.txt  test2.txt  test3.txt

$ cat test1.txt
2
0 1
1 0
---
1
```

Run `attest ./a.out` to test your program `./a.out` against the test files:

```console
$ attest ./a.out
PASS  0:01  test1.txt
PASS  0:05  test2.txt
PASS  0:03  test3.txt
```

Each line shows test outcome, execution time and test filename. The test
outcome is one of these:

| Outcome | Meaning                      |
|---------|------------------------------|
| PASS    | Program output was correct   |
| FAIL    | Program output was incorrect |
| TIME    | Program took too long        |
| DEAD    | Program crashed              |

Pass `-v` option to inspect the output of failed tests.

```console
$ attest -v ./a.out
PASS  0:01  test1.txt
FAIL  0:00  test2.txt

FAIL  test2.txt
  Test case
    IN:
    3
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 0
    OUT:
    9
  Program output
    OUT:
    0
```
