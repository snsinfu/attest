attest is a command-line tool that tests a program for given input and expected
output. I made this for quickly checking validity of my program locally when
solving competitive programming problems.

## Usage

Create test files in `tests` directory as `*.txt` files. Test file contains
program input and expected output delimited by "---".

```console
$ ls tests
test1.txt  test2.txt  test3.txt

$ cat test1.txt
2
0 1
1 0
---
1
```

Run `attest ./a.out` to test your program `./a.out` against the test files:

```console
$ attest ./a.out
PASS  0:01  test1.txt
PASS  0:05  test2.txt
PASS  0:03  test3.txt
```

Each line shows test result, execution time and test filename. The test result
can be one of these:

| Result | Meaning                      |
|--------|------------------------------|
| PASS   | Program output was correct   |
| FAIL   | Program output was incorrect |
| TIME   | Program took too long        |
| DEAD   | Program crashed              |
