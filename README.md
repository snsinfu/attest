## Usage

Create test files in `tests` directory as `*.txt` files. Test file contains
program input and expected output delimited by "---".

```
$ ls tests
test1.txt  test2.txt  test3.txt

$ cat test1.txt
2
0 1
1 0
---
1
```

Run `attest ./a.out` to test your program `./a.out` against the test files:

```
$ attest ./a.out
PASS test1.txt
PASS test2.txt
PASS test3.txt
```

The test result can be one of these:

| Result | Meaning                      |
|--------|------------------------------|
| PASS   | Program output was correct   |
